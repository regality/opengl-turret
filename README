OPENGL TURRET
=============

This is mostly just a fun little hack.
Feel free to do with it as you please.

RUNNING
=======

To get it running, clone the git repository and build it:

   bash> git clone git://github.com/regality/opengl-turret.git turret
   bash> cd turret
   bash> make run

PLAYING
=======

Space bar shoots.

Pressing m switches between guns and rockets.

Use arrow keys to look around.

Shoot all the planes as fast as you can.

Planes come 10 at a time.
After shooting down all ten, ten stronger planes come.

GAMEPLAY SPECIFICS
==================

Guns are fully automatic, but only do 1 damage.
Rockets are semi-automatic, but do 50 damage.

Each plane has 10 health points multiplied by the level you are at.
So the planes in the first wave have only 10 health, in the second
wave each has 20 health, and so on.

Once a plane recieves any damage it slows
to a crawl and is an easy target.
