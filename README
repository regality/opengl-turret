OPENGL TURRET
=============

This is mostly just a fun little hack.
Feel free to do with it as you please.

RUNNING
=======

To get it running, clone the git repository:

   bash> git clone git://github.com/regality/opengl-turret.git turret

Then just build it and shoot:

   bash> cd turret
   bash> make run

PLAYING
=======

Space bar shoots.

Use arrow keys to look around.

Shoot all the planes as fast as you can.
